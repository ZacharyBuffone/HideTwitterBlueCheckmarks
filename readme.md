## Hide Twitter Blue Checkmarks

This extension just removes the blue checkmarks on Twitter.

...thats it. Its a useless feature anyways.

# How to install

Chrome really doesn't like installing extensions from outside the Chrome Web Store, so we have to do a work around.

1. Download the HideTwitterBlueCheckmark_v1.zip and unzip somewhere.
2. Open chrome and type "chrome://extensions" into the address bar.
3. Click on the "Developer Mode" toggle on the top right of the page (if you haven't previously).
4. Press the "Load uppacked" button on the top left of the page. Find where you unzipped the .zip previously and select it.


The extension should be installed now. You can verify it has installed this by going to "chrome://extensions". The toggle next to this extension shoud be blue.
